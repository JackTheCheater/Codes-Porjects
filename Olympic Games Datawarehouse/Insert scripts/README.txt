STEP 3: TABLES' FEEDING

Now we will fill the tables created in the previous step using data from the operational data sources, we rely on python scripts in order to add the missing "year" value and mapping the csv files in sql files with all the inserts already written rightly.

In order to generate the sql files, the 6 csv files in the directory number 1 have to be included in the same directory of the 2 python scripts deployed here, then running them from command line will generate the 2 sql files (the 2 sql files included in this directory are samples of how the generated files should be)
