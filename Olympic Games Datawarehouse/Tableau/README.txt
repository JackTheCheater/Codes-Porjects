STEP 6: TABLEAU

This directory contains the csv files we extracted from our DW corresponding to the primary and secondary FTs and DT.

In order to obtain graphics from results_ft, it has to be joined with participants_dt, the other 2 tables don't need to be joined with something else and can be used on their own because they are secondary FTs already containing all the dimensional attributes needed.
